        "- handling API keys in a remote environment (colab)\n",
        "- parsing the large CSV files which, if read all at once, will exceed colab's memory and cause the notebook to crash.\n",

        "# Initial Setup\n",
        "First, we install and import the necessary packages. If you don't care about all of the resulting messages, uncomment # %%capture at the top of the cell; this will hide all of the output. "
